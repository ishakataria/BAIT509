1. Pros of hiring A are that there is greater chance of A’s productivity being equal to 75 with a confidence interval of 
95% that his productivity will be between 72.5 to 77.5. But on the other hand, B has a lesser chance of productivity being 
equal to 75. With a 95% confidence interval the productivity of B can range from 67.5 to 82.5 but these chances are much 
lower due to the smaller density. A offers a 75 productivity with a reasonable confidence, but with lower confidence B can 
offer higher productivity. The tradeoff is between being certain or getting more or even less with uncertainty so it depends 
on what the business’ need is.

2. Pros of A are that there are very high chances that his productivity is centered around 60, but for B, with lower 
confidence, his productivity is centered around 80. 

3. There are more than necessary variables taken into account hence the forecast distribution is skewed
